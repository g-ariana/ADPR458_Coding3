    <h1>We're Le Puzz and we love jigsaw puzzles! We collect them, we do them with friends and family, we give them away and trade them when we're finished. We especially love collecting vintage puzzles from the 60s, 70s and 80s with an odd sense of humor.</h1>

        <p>We love old puzzle box illustrations, silly copy, weird jigsaw shapes and of course interesting images. There really isn't anything like that feeling of finishing a puzzle and running your hand over it, then trying to pick it up off the table in one piece.
          <lb>
          We started Le Puzz with all of this in mind and set out to create a puzzle experience that we thought was fun and we hope you enjoy as well.

      <h2>WHAT ARE "RANDOM-CUT PIECES"?</h2>
      <p>Most puzzles are either ribbon cut or random cut. A ribbon-cut puzzle is cut in a uniform grid with a few different piece shapes. Random-cut puzzles look like a land of whimsy with pieces going in all kinds of directions!</p>

      <h2>"EXTRA-THICK" PIECES</h2>
      <p>There is nothing more annoying than a thin, flimsy puzzle that won‚Äôt stay together while you‚Äôre working it. Together with our manufacturer, we‚Äôve worked hard to design the Le Puzz piece that is reminiscent of some of our favorite vintage puzzles.</p>

      <h2>Earth-Friendly</h2>
      <p>Another thing we love about puzzles is that they‚Äôre a pretty green product. We try to limit the amount of plastic that we use in both the production and distribution of each puzzle. We use FSC approved paper sources for our boxes and puzzles to make sure all the paper we use comes from sustainable forests. We‚Äôve also provided a resealable bag that can be used again and again.</p>
